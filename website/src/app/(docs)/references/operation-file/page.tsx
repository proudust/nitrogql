        <h2>Operation file reference</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>operation type definition file</b> is generated next to each
          GraphQL operation file. It expresses the types of the GraphQL
          operation, especially the types of variables and the type of the
          response.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the default setting, the file has a <code>.d.graphql.ts</code>{" "}
          extension. This is to tell TypeScript what happens if you import the
          corresponding <code>.graphql</code> file.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page documents what you can import from the <code>.graphql</code>{" "}
          file.
        </p>

        <h3 id="operation-object">Operation Object</h3>
        <p>
          The operation object is the type of the object you can pass to a
          GraphQL client to execute the operation. It has the type{" "}
          <code>TypedDocumentNode&lt;Result, Variables&gt;</code>, where{" "}
          <code>Result</code> is the type of the response and{" "}
          <code>Variables</code> is the type of the variables required by the
          operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the default setting, the operation object is exported as a
          default export. You can import it like:
        </p>
        <Highlight language="typescript">
          {`import getTodosQuery from "./getTodos.graphql";`}
        </Highlight>
        <p>
          By configuring the{" "}
          <Link href="/configuration/options#generate.export.defaultExportForOperation">
            <code>defaultExportForOperation</code>
          </Link>{" "}
          option, you can change this to a named export:
        </p>
        <Highlight language="typescript">
          {`import { getTodosQuery } from "./operation.graphql";`}
        </Highlight>
        <p>
          The name of the export is determined by the name of the operation. See
          the references for{" "}
          <Link href="/configuration/options#generate.name">
            <code>generate.name</code>
          </Link>{" "}
          on how to configure generated names.
        </p>

        <h3 id="results-and-variables">Results and Variables</h3>
        <p>
          By default, <code>Result</code> and <code>Variables</code> types are
          not exported. However, you can configure the{" "}
          <Link href="/configuration/options#generate.export">
            <code>generate.export</code>
          </Link>{" "}
          option to export those as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you configure the option to export results and variables, they are
          exported as named exports. Example usage:
        </p>
        <Highlight language="typescript">
          {`import { getTodosQuery, type GetTodosQueryResult, type GetTodosQueryVariables } from "./operation.graphql";`}
        </Highlight>

        <h3 id="fragment-object">Fragment Object</h3>
        <p>
          A fragment definition also generates a fragment object. It has the
          type <code>TypedDocumentNode&lt;Result, never&gt;</code>, where{" "}
          <code>Result</code> is the shape of a query response that matches the
          fragment.
        </p>
        <p>The fragment object is exported as a named export. Example usage:</p>
        <Highlight language="typescript">
          {`import { todoFragment } from "./todo.graphql";`}
        </Highlight>
      </main>
    </Toc>
  );
}
